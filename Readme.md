Just some experiments with fractals. 

Used to explore interactively a Mandelbrotset or Juliaset in low resolution in a cv2 window, or to render high resolution pictures with various Colermaps.
Also implemented functions to render series of pictures with various zoom values. 

Most options can be changed by altering the global variables in the code. See comments.
Starts by opening a interactiv window to explore the Mandelbrotset (left click: zoom in, right click: zoom out, q quit).

Uses numpy and cv2. 
Very crude, no clean code.
